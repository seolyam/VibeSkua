# Skua 1.4.0.5
## Released: January 28, 2026

# Things Added

## UI / Menu Changes
- `Options > CoreBots` & the Class dropdown from the `Auto` menu
  - Equipment & Classes are now sorted alphabetically

## Tools
- Tool for us Script-Devs / Those that wish to see a Boss/Shop that is quest locked;
  - Available in:
    - `Tools > Grabber > Quests`
    - `Tools > Loader`
  - Added a `Fake Complete` button
    - Runs `Bot.Quests.UpdateQuest(ID)`

  - **Previously** this had to be done via:
    - `Tools > Console`
    - Manually typing `Bot.Quests.UpdateQuest(<QuestID>);`

  - **Now** you can:
    - Open either `Tools > Loader` **or** `Tools > Grabber > Quests`
    - For **Grabber > Quests**:
      - Quests must already be loaded in-game
      - Press **Grab**
      - Select the quest
      - Click **Fake Complete**
    - For **Loader**:
      - Select the quest
      - Click **Fake Complete**

  - Usage notes:
    - Run this **outside** the map you want to see the shop/mob in, then join the map
    - You will **not** be able to:
      - Buy items (they are still quest locked)
      - Complete quests you have "fake" progressed to
    - *But* you **will** be able to see the boss/shop

## Script-Dev Stuff
- Added the rest of the `Bot.Lite.*` options for code fill-in  
  - **Script-dev only** (normal users can ignore this)
  - Mirrors the in-game `Options > Advanced` menu

# Skua 1.4.0.4
## Released: January 23, 2026

## Changes/Fixes

- Compiler race conditions hopefully fixed
- Search scripts causing a lockup should be fixed
- Refactored Skua.AS3 for quicker navigation
- Auras should be more reliable in advanced skills
  - Apparently, AQW doesn't handle their expired auras, and they stay inside the aura array, thus causing overflow issues

**Full Changelog**:[`1.4.0.3...1.4.0.4`](<https://github.com/auqw/Skua/compare/1.4.0.3...1.4.0.4>)

# Skua 1.4.0.3
## Released: January 19, 2026

## Actually fixed compiler

### Code that was the issue:
```cs
Span<Range> lineRanges = stackalloc Range[256];
```
This only read 256 imports, while a few had more than 256, and I was not aware of that.

Scripts tested:
- `0AllClasses.cs`
- `0AllStories.cs`
- `0FarmerJoeDoAll.cs`
- `0VoidHighlord.cs`
- `JoePrepsForUltras.cs` (this is for Insert's scripts for Grim)

**Full Changelog**:[`1.4.0.2...1.4.0.3`](<https://github.com/auqw/Skua/compare/1.4.0.2...1.4.0.3>)

# Skua 1.4.0.2
## Released: January 18, 2026

# Auto-Hunt & Auto-Attack Changelog

Fixed:
•  Auto-Hunt now properly moves between cells when targeted monsters are killed
•  Auto-Hunt continues hunting same monster type after killing individual instances
•  Priority MapID hunting now camps specific cells and waits for respawns
•  Reduced hunt delays for faster monster targeting (1000ms → 200ms) 
•  Optimized cell traversal to reduce unnecessary full map rescans

Technical:
•  Changed from MapID-based to name-based hunting for targeted monsters
•  Priority MapIDs now camp single cells instead of searching multiple locations

# Skua 1.4.0.0
## Released: January 18, 2026

## Changes/Fixes

### [**.NET 10**](<https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/10.0>)  I am sorry, Windows 7 users, it was bound to happen. 
Please go ahead and download the new net version for [Skua 1.4.0.0](<https://github.com/auqw/Skua/releases/tag/1.4.0.0>).

### Compiler Changes
- Added a check for `version: #.#.#.#` in the first 6 lines of a script.
  - If a version number is present and it's higher than your current Skua version, it'll prompt you to update and open the Skua release page.
    - This will stop compilation immediately so no errors are thrown
 
- Added a Mutex for the compiler so only one account will compile while the others wait for that one to finish.

- The compiler now builds each `//cs_include` file

With these compiler changes come higher initial compile times (expected)
Using `0FarmerJoeKitDoAll.cs` as a performance test between 1.3.3.2 and 1.4.0.0

1.3.3.2: ~7 seconds
1.4.0.0: ~14-16 seconds

However, if any `Core` files update, we'll only need to recompile the one that updated; thus, consecutive compiles can get as low as ~2 seconds.

## Additions
- Tools > Loader 
  - Added updating from the scripts repo to always have the latest if it gets updated there aswell
  - Added `Update Range` with a textbox for a range of `QuestIDs`
  - Added `Copy Name+IDS` output is `// {questName} | {questID}`

This update is "small", however, we are dropping support for Windows 7, so I think the bump to 1.4.0.0 was a good idea

# Skua 1.3.3.2
## Released: January 14, 2026

# Quest.txt is now QuestData.json and it updates from scripts [repo ](https://github.com/auqw/Scripts/blob/Skua/QuestData.json) now

# Skua 1.3.3.1
## Released: January 10, 2026


# Features/Changes

### Auto-Attack | Auto-Hunt
  - `Manual MapIDs` now work properly, and will attack MID[index 0], then MID[index 1]. If MID[index 0] respawns while MID[index 1] is alive, it will swap mobs 👍 

### Packet Interceptor 
  - Packet logging when `Log packets` is unchecked is now fixed

### Compiler Changes/Script Caching
  - Scripts get cached to `%APPDATA%/Skua/Scripts/Cached-Scripts`
  - This improves startup time for re-running scripts (assuming `auqw/Scripts` isn't updating as you are running them)
  - There are still planned changes to the compiler

### Planned changes for the compiler
  - Currently, the compiler takes each script we use for a certain script into one single file, then compiles that into the final running script.
  - Example: `0NecroticSwordOfDoom.cs` uses `CoreNSOD.cs` and that needs. `CoreBots.cs` (`0NecroticSwordOfDoom`>`CoreNSOD`>`CoreBots`)
  - This way of compiling for cached scripts is terrible. Anytime any script in that flow changes, it'll need to recompile everything.
  - So, to remedy this, I want to change the compiler to compile each script separately

### Minor Optimizations

### UI Changes
  - Accounts with tags will now align correctly
  - Whenever you get the `443` error for scripts, a pop-up will open saying
    - "Unable to connect to GitHub."
    - "Please check your internet connection and try again."
    - "If the problem persists, GitHub may be temporarily unavailable."

# Skua 1.3.2.0
## Released: December 18, 2025

### Fixes
 - Auto > Attack/Hunt;
   - Targeting now works properly to what you click on and doesn't stray from it.

   - Quests can now have an optional `RewardID` ( for those "choose reward" quests), reward + accept/requirement's id will also be added.
   - Turn-ins will now use multi-turn-in. ( more turn-ins at once, before it did it one at a time)
 - `Bot.Quests.RegisterQuests();` can now also accept reward ids alongside the id... 
 E.G.:
 ```cs
 Bot.Quests.RegisterQuests((1,1), (2,3));
 ```
 - Helpers > Current Drops;
   - Search function added.
 - Faster AA[0] for CSH/CSS/other
 - Auto > Attack/Hunt;
   - Faster target swapping
   - You can insert a `MonsterMapID` array ( e.g., 1,2,3), and it'll attack them in order, going back to the beginning of the order if and when it respawns.

# Skua 1.3.0.0
## Released: November 10, 2025

## What's Changed
* Aura support for scripts and advskills
* Rounded Corners for Windows 11 users
* More memory leaks have been fixed
* Update InventoryItem.cs by @SharpTheNightmare in https://github.com/auqw/Skua/pull/5
* Canuseskill skill check by @SharpTheNightmare in https://github.com/auqw/Skua/pull/6
* CollectionViewer will not have full priority by @SharpTheNightmare in https://github.com/auqw/Skua/pull/7
* Forced skill.auto to false by @SharpTheNightmare in https://github.com/auqw/Skua/pull/11
* Added ProcID And updated Documentation by @SharpTheNightmare in https://github.com/auqw/Skua/pull/12
* added wikilinks (limited) by @SharpTheNightmare in https://github.com/auqw/Skua/pull/18
* added death reset to advskills by @SharpTheNightmare in https://github.com/auqw/Skua/pull/19
* `%LOCALAPPDATA%` config files have moved to `%APPDATA%`. The whole config system had to be written from scratch, so now the problem is that sometimes something randomly goes wrong and resets the config that just will not happen (`%APPDATA%\Skua\ManagerSettings.json` and `%APPDATA%\Skua\ClientSettings.json`)

### If you know how to get your accounts from the `Skua.Manager` config folder, the new format is

From this
```xml
<string>DisplayerName{=}AccName{=}Password</string>
```
to 
```json
"DisplayName{=}AccName{=}Password"
```
e.g., new config for multiple

```json
"ManagedAccounts": [
    "User1{=}User1{=}Password1",
    "User2{=}User2{=}Password2",
    "User3{=}User3{=}Password3"
  ],
```
## TATO JOINED SKUA TEAM!!!!
