# VibeSkua
> **Note:** This project is **Vibe Coded**—built through AI-assisted development, and pure momentum.

A feature-rich, high-performance fork of [auqw/skua](https://github.com/auqw/skua) built from V1.4.3.0, made for advanced automation, stability, and streamlined multi-client management.

## Skua Architecture Comparison
The following overview compares the systems and core features between the original `auqw/skua` repository and VibeSkua.

### Quality of Life & Features

| Feature | Original | This Fork |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discord Integration** | Lacked native capability. | `DiscordWebhookService` integrated natively. Supports automated alerts for status changes, rare drops (with screenshots), and live-pings. |
| **Headless Mode** | Full-screen rendering; high resource demand per instance. | Introduced a 1x1 hidden pixel viewport, forcing Flash to bypass geometry/blitting and significantly reducing resource consumption. |
| **Script Scheduling** | Required manual initialization and supervision with static script options. | Added autonomous script queuing, supporting independent option profiles and custom display names per instance. |
| **Account Tabs** | Required running individual instances which clutters the screen. | Embedded `EmbeddedMainWindow.xaml` with dynamic SWF patching for a unified, tabbed WPF interface. |
| **Script Sorting** | Basic navigation options. | Expanded `ScriptRepoViewModel.cs` to support dynamic sorting by Name, Date, or script category (Ascending/Descending). |
| **Pause Functionality** | Could only fully Stop scripts, entirely losing current progression. | Built a native `Pause` feature that safely freezes the execution thread in place, letting you interact with menus and seamlessly resume later. |
| **Smart Grid View** | Required managing dozens of overlapping individual windows. | Consolidates all active accounts into a clean, clutter-free grid inside a single window to monitor a full army at once. |
| **Instance Dashboard** | Lacked a native farming statistics dashboard. | Pinned a native Side Dashboard directly to the game frame to track Kills, Drops, and Quests at a glance. |
| **Function Based Skills** | Relied on static, hardcoded skill sequences without situational awareness. | Integrated a conditional combat engine that evaluates health, cooldowns, and missing auras natively via C# before casting. |
| **Streamer Mode** | Basic privacy capabilities. | Actively scrubs character names, guild tags, room numbers, and disables chat via background asynchronous Flash injection. |
| **Auto-Relogin Resilience** | Basic relogin handling prone to freezing during network timeouts. | Redesigned with asynchronous task scheduling, dynamic alternative server selection, and fallback socket injection. |
| **Army Control** | Required managing each client independently. | Features an integrated Army Control system to instantly broadcast Start/Stop commands, map jumps, and game settings to all active instances simultaneously. |
| **Custom Hotkeys** | Relied on static, hardcoded keyboard shortcuts. | Replaced static keybinds with a dynamic `IHotKeyService` leveraging `NHotkey.Wpf`. Integrates natively with `ISettingsService` to allow full user customization of core application commands across the entire WPF interface. |

### Performance & Engine Optimizations

* **SWF Memory Caching:** Implemented `PreloadSwf()` in `FlashUtil.cs` to cache files directly in RAM, accelerating instance launches. Enforced `WMode="direct"` for hardware-accelerated rendering.
* **Network Proxy Optimization:** Refactored `CaptureProxy.cs` to utilize `Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes()` for packet conversion, minimizing latency during high-traffic sessions.
* **GitHub Script Caching Engine:** Engineered `ScriptDates.json` to store metadata and track SHA hashes. Intelligent API querying conserves rate limits and provides graceful UI fallbacks on connection failure.
* **Background Connection Stability:** Repositions inactive clients off-screen and uses a `WPF DispatcherTimer` to ping the `isLoggedIn` COM interface every 500ms, preventing OS-level socket throttling.
* **Active Memory Management:** Introduced `MemoryUtils.cs` to periodically trim the application’s working set, ensuring RAM stability during long, multi-day farming sessions.
* **Function Based Skills Architecture:** Bypassed the legacy JSON sequence parsing system entirely. Scripters can now inject raw C# classes (`ISkillProvider`) directly into the combat thread at runtime. This eliminates RAM overhead and allows for microsecond-accurate evaluations of aura durations, exact cooldown states, and complex mathematical conditions before broadcasting a skill to Flash.
* **Asynchronous Flash Injection:** Built a background loop to actively override ActionScript 3 variables (e.g., `world.strMapName`) every 500ms to maintain privacy in Streamer Mode.
* **Resilient Socket Fallbacks:** Upgraded the relogin protocol to actively poll Flash XML payloads (`mcLogin.sl.iList.numChildren`) instead of static delays, using direct `ConnectIP()` as a safety fallback.
* **Release Portability:** Updated plugins like Daily Tracker with PostBuild MSBuild targets to automatically compile and bundle into the release folder during `BuildRelease.bat`.
* **Velopack Deployment Architecture:** Fully migrated the deployment infrastructure to Velopack. Enables rapid silent installations, automatic desktop shortcut provisioning, and a built-in Updater Tab within the Manager for seamless background auto-updating via the GitHub Releases API.
* And alot more that i cannot remember.

## Building the Project

There are two ways to build the project:

1. **Automated:** Navigate to the root folder and run the **BuildRelease.bat** file. Once completed, your output files will be located in a newly created **"Build"** folder within the same directory.

2. **Manual (Terminal):** Navigate to the root folder, right-click, select **"Open in Terminal"**, and run the following command:

```bash
dotnet build Skua.sln -c Release -p:WarningLevel=0 --nologo
```
